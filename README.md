# taskMaster

For this project,we are thinking about making a scheduling app.This app would request things you want to get done, level of importance, and numberof breaks. Then the app will request a pattern for the items and then implement aschedule for the user. This app will use notifications to remind the user. Weâ€™re thinking this will be a good base projectand more complex ideas can be added throughout the semester time permitting
