# taskMaster

For this project, we are thinking about making a scheduling app. This app would request things you want to get done, level of importance, and number of breaks. Then the app will request a pattern for the items and then implement a schedule for the user. This app will use notifications to remind the user. Weâ€™re thinking this will be a good base project and more complex ideas can be added throughout the semester time permitting.
